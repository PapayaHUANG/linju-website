Two podcast hosts met through a programming community—one based in the Bay Area and the other in Shanghai. One is an experienced coder, while the other is a newbie in the coding world. They hit it off instantly when it came to starting a podcast.

If you also enjoy listening to podcasts at double speed, and if Lawrence LI has played a significant role in your podcast listening history, and you occasionally browse "少数派" (a tech-related platform), you might find these two podcast hosts quite appealing. At least, these were a few moments that lit up in the female host's mind as she got to know the male host.

In this podcast, you'll get to hear discussions on development, technology, English learning, and more.
